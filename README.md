These are a few projects from my web design classes in schoo, as well as the KnowingGod course from Bible.org that I worked on for a few years.

KnowingGod is mostly Elementor with a lot of handwritten CSS, HTML, and JavaScript by me. 

I also have various mockups not shown here that lack functionality.

Note that the school portfolio lacks significantly functionality with various missing pages.
